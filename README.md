# Customer Churn Analysis & Retention Strategy

This project focuses on improving student retention in a programming school by analyzing factors driving customer churn and designing incentive mechanisms for teachers. The work is structured around **six key objectives**:

1) ### Analyzing Customer Churn Drivers (🗝️ Data Preprocessing)
I conducted a comprehensive analysis of student attrition, identifying patterns and key factors contributing to churn. This included studying the reasons reported by parents of students who discontinued their education. The findings highlighted issues with students’ motivation to learn programming. 
The school has established KPIs to monitor teachers’ implementation of motivational practices. These KPIs are defined in the “Regulations on KPIs in the Personnel Evaluation System” and incorporated into teacher contracts. However, despite these preventive measures, student motivation continues to decline.
This raised a key research question: Are teachers adequately meeting the company’s motivational KPIs? This question became the starting point for deeper investigation.

2) ### Financial Assessment of Losses for the School from Customer Churn (🗝️ Feature Engineering)
I conducted a financial analysis to estimate the losses the school incurs due to customer churn, both at the company level and per teacher, on average, per year. The analysis revealed that the financial impact of churn per teacher is almost nine times lower than the company’s overall loss percentage.
This finding led to an important insight: teachers have significantly less financial motivation to meet the KPIs than the company that designed them.

3) ### Researching and Evaluating Achievement of KPI by Teachers (🗝️ Feature Engineering)
I analyzed teachers’ performance on motivational KPIs and investigated the underlying reasons for their achievement levels. The results showed that the overall KPI achievement rate was quite low.
The analysis suggested that this low performance may be driven by insufficient teacher motivation. The motivational KPIs lacked meaningful financial incentives — teachers were expected to fulfill them almost for free, relying primarily on personal enthusiasm.
This finding led me to examine the school’s current teacher reward system and its effectiveness in supporting KPI achievement.

4) ### Forecasting the Impact of KPI Performance on Customer Churn (🗝️ Statistical & Predictive Modeling)
I conducted a factor analysis to measure the extent to which teacher behavior influences client loss rates, using the **Mann–Whitney U test** to compare groups statistically.
In addition, I built a predictive model linking teachers’ KPI performance to student dropout rates, leveraging a **Random Forest Regressor**. This model confirmed the existence of a relationship and quantified the impact of each individual KPI on the percentage of lost clients.

5) ### Proposal, Forecast and Evaluation of Teacher Incentive Systems (🗝️ Statistical & Predictive Modeling)
I proposed two alternative bonus systems aimed at increasing teachers’ KPI performance levels. Using predictive modeling, I forecasted the impact of each option on KPI growth, selected the most promising system, and evaluated its effect on the target metric — achieving higher overall KPI performance.
To support this analysis, I built a **Random Forest Classifier model** to estimate the likelihood of KPI improvement under the proposed bonus systems compared to the current approach.

6) ### Financial Assessment of Incentive System (🗝️ Visualization & Results & Reporting)
I calculated the reduction in student dropout rates associated with increased KPI performance using a **Logistic Regression model**. Additionally, I conducted a financial analysis to estimate the additional profit that could be generated by implementing the new teacher bonus system.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Together, these tasks form a comprehensive approach to understanding and addressing the root causes of student churn, while leveraging teacher motivation as a key lever for long-term retention and school growth.

It was developed as a **side project** based on real anonymized educational data collected during my work in an EdTech company (fictionalized as **"BrightMind School"**).

## 📊 Project Overview

### About the Company:  
**BrightMind School** is a fictionalized programming school (based on a real EdTech company I worked for).  The school provides coding education for children and teenagers, focusing on interactive classes and personalized mentorship. Classes at the school are held once a week. The academic year begins on August 1 and ends on July 31.

As a data analyst, I was responsible for tracking key metrics such as **reasons for students losing motivation**, **reasons for student dropout**, and **accordance of lesson structure with school standards**. Also, I developed strategies for working with teachers and searched for ways to improve the teaching process, provided personalized mentorship.

## 🎯 Goal

To identify the main key factor driving customer churn and to estimate the impact of improving teachers’ KPI performance (LKPI & BKPI) on reducing churn and increasing overall profitability.

**Conclusion 2:**
By all indicators, **"Best_One_Year" teachers significantly outperform "Bad_One_Year"**.
The main difference is in the quality of communication, control, and proactive work with risks, which is directly reflected in student success.

**table 3 "RandomForestRegressor model results"**
| Metric                     | Value |
|---------------------------|------:|
| **Target**           | student_loss_number |
| **R2**               | 0.999  |
| **MAE**              | 0.031  |
| **RMSE**             | 0.057 |

**Conclusion 3:**
The coefficient of determination is almost 1, indicating an extremely high accuracy of the model. This means that the model explains 99.9% of the variation in the target variable - student number of loss.
The average absolute error is only 0.031. This means that on average the model forecast deviates from the actual values ​​by 3.1% (if we imagine that the target is expressed in percentages).
The root mean square error is 0.057. Since RMSE is more sensitive to large deviations, this low result shows that the model is not only consistently accurate, but also almost completely free of large errors.
✅ Taken together, these values ​​indicate that the constructed model has high predictive ability and can be used to interpret the importance of KPI contributions to the probability of student dropout.

**table 4 "Interpretation of results through SHAP-values"**
| Feature                     | Mean_SHAP_Abs |
|---------------------------|------:|
| **importance_of_homework**    | 0.79052 |
| **importance_of_success**     | 0.321124 |
| **importance_of_loss**        | 0.304658 |
| **importance_of_students**    | 0.269554 |
| **importance_of_parents**     | 0.114054 |

**Conclusion 4:**
The most important KPI for predicting dropouts is homework checking. Other factors—student performance, monitoring potential dropouts, and feedback to students—have significant but smaller impacts. Communication with parents makes the weakest contribution to the model.

**table 5 "RandomForestClassifier model results: Impact of Bonus Systems on Teachers' Motivation to Achieve KPIs"**

| Class           | precision | recall | f1-score | support |
|-----------------|-----------|--------|----------|---------|
| **Class 0**      | 0.824     | 0.848  | 0.836    | 99 |
| **Class 1**      | 0.571     | 0.526  | 0.548    | 38 |
| **accuracy**    | 0.759     | —      | —        | 137 |
| **macro avg**   | 0.697     | 0.687  | 0.692    | 137 |
| **weighted avg**| 0.754     | 0.759  | 0.756    | 137 |
| **ROC AUC**     | 0.819     | —      | —        | — |

**Conclusion 5:**
The model shows good overall performance with accuracy of ≈76% and high ROC AUC, but the classification of the smaller class needs improvement. Possible improvement strategies include  additional hyperparameter tuning.

**table 6 "Feature Importance**:

| Feature        | Importance |
|---------------|------------|
| **Bonus_v1**  | 0.709      |
| **Bonus**     | 0.146      |
| **Bonus_v2**  | 0.145      |

**Conclusion 6:**
Bonus_v1 (≈71%) – the most influential feature, driving the majority of predictions.
Bonus and Bonus_v2 (≈14–15% each) – less impactful but still important, helping refine classification when Bonus_v1 alone is not decisive.
Overall, the model relies primarily on Bonus_v1, with Bonus and Bonus_v2 serving as supporting features to improve prediction accuracy.

***table 7 - Logistic Regression results (Impact of Bonus_v1 application on the percentage of KPI fulfillment by teachers):**

| Metrics                     | Values |
|------------------------------|----------|
| **ATE (logit)**               | **1.344** |
| **Odds Ratio (OR)**           | **3.83** |
| **p₀ (without target raise)** | **0.095 (9.5%)** |
| **p₁ (with target raise)**    | **0.287 (28.7%)** |
| **Absolute Loss Decrease**    | **19.2%** |

**Conclusion 7:**  
The bonus system **Bonus_v1** has a statistically significant and practically important positive effect. It significantly increases the chances of teachers to achieve both **Learning KPIs** and **Business KPIs**, which makes it an effective tool for staff motivation. Therefore, if the Bonus_v1 bonus system is implemented, the performance of KPI indicators will also increase (as the model RandomForestClassifier showed).

**table 8 - Logistic Regression results (Impact of KPI improvement on student churn):**

| Metric                     | Value |
|---------------------------|------:|
| **ATE (logit)**           | 0.905 |
| **Odds Ratio**            | 2.47  |
| **p₀ (without target raise)** | 0.370 |
| **p₁ (with target raise)**    | 0.592 |
| **Absolute Loss Decrease** | **22.2%** |

**Conclusion 9:**  
> Implementing a target-raising bonus system for teachers is estimated to **reduce client churn by 2.47x** and increase retention probability by **≈22.2%**.
